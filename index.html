      <p>Hii baby!! HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, MY WIFE!!</p>
      <p>To the person I love the most – thank you so much for being there for me even though my life is like a rollercoaster with no finish line. Thank you for your patience and support. Being appreciated by you is the most important thing I’ve ever wanted to feel.</p>
      <p>Before, I only dreamed of having this kind of love – with understanding, patience, support, and a partner for everything. Thank God He gave you to me.</p>
      <p>Baby, I always do my best for you. Like the song says: "Papahiram ko sa iyo ang aking dalawang mata. Para malaman mo kung pa'no kita nakikita" – I hope you know how much I see you in every way possible.</p>
      <p>I want only you to be there, waiting for me. No matter how far apart we are or where I am, you’re the one I want. I don’t want or wish for anything else except to be with you. I’ll cherish you as long as you’re mine, and you’ll always be mine.</p>
      <p>We’ve already celebrated Christmas, New Year, our first monthsary, and now this is our first Valentine’s Day. I count every single celebration with you, my love.</p>
      <p>I’ll always be your source of light – to remind you that even if everyone leaves you and you’re left alone in the dark, you’ll always have me. "To love you is to hold a lantern in the dark, not just to show you the way, but to remind you that you are never walking alone."</p>
      <p>Lagi kang meron ako na pipiliin at mananatili sa araw-araw. I really, really love you so much, my wife!!</p>
